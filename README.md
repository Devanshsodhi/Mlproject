Project Overview
Uses machine learning models to analyze and forecast stock price movements.

Integrates sentiment analysis, extracting market sentiment from financial news or social media data to enrich predictions.

Entirely implemented in Python.

Key Features
Combines quantitative historical stock data with qualitative sentiment data for improved prediction accuracy.

Applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training steps typical in end-to-end ML pipelines.

Demonstrates practical application of natural language processing (NLP) for financial analysis.

Technologies and Workflow
Python-based development for data handling, modeling, and sentiment analysis.

Utilizes established machine learning and NLP libraries for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

Focuses on deploying a robust workflow from data ingestion to prediction output
